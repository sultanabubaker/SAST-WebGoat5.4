<p><b>Lesson Plan Title:</b> Role Based Access Control: Stage 2</p>

<p><b>Concept / Topic To Teach:</b><br/>
In role-based access control scheme, a role represents 
a set of access permissions and privileges. A user can be 
assigned one or more roles. A role-based access control 
normally consists of two parts: role permission management 
and role assignment. A broken role-based access 
control scheme might allow a user to perform accesses 
that are not allowed by his/her assigned roles, or 
somehow obtain unauthorized roles.
</p> 

<p><b>General Goal(s):</b><br/>
Your goal is to explore the access control 
rules that govern this site. Each role has permission to 
certain resources (A-F). Each user is assigned one or more roles. 
Only the user with the [Admin] role should have access 
to the 'F' resources. In a successful attack, a user doesn't 
have the [Admin] role can access resource F.
</p>

<p>
<b>Solution:</b><br/>
You have to be sure that the user is AUTHORIZED to do an action! So you have to check for his authorization.
You have to write some code in the class 
org.owasp.webgoat.lessons.RoleBasedAccesControl.RoleBasedAccessControl.java.
Alter the handleRequest method as there is happening the dispatching.
There is already a method called isAuthorized which you can use:
</p>
<pre><code>
//***************CODE HERE*************************
if(!isAuthorized(s, getUserId(s), requestedActionName))
{
  throw new UnauthorizedException();
}									
//*************************************************
</code></pre>
Try the attack again and you will see that the authorization fails and the
lesson is completed.
