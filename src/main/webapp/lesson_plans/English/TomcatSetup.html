<h1>How To Configure Tomcat</h1><br><br>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>WebGoat comes with default configurations for Tomcat. This page will explain these configurations
and other possible configurations for Tomcat. This is just 
a short description which should be enough in most cases. For more advanced tasks please 
refer to the Tomcat documentation. Please note that all solutions
are written for the standard configurations on port 80. If you use another port you have 
to adjust the solution to your configuration.</p>

<h2>The Standard Configurations</h2>
<p>There are two standard Tomcat configurations. In the basic configurations you use the server on your localhost.
	Both are identically with the only difference
	that in one tomcat is running on port 80 and 443 (SSL) and in the other tomcat is running on port 8080 and 8443. In Linux you have
	to start WebGoat as root or with sudo if you want to run it on port 80 and
	443.
	As running software as root is dangerous we strongly advice to use
the port 8080 and 8443. In Windows you can
run WebGoat.bat to run it on port 80 and WebGoat_8080.bat to run it on port 8080. In Linux you
can use webgoat.sh and run it with webgoat.sh start80 or webgoat.sh start8080. The user in these
configurations is guest with password guest
</p>

<h2>Server Configurations</h2>
<p>
If you are a single user of WebGoat the standard configurations should be
enough but if you want to use WebGoat in laboratory or in class there
might be the need to change the configurations. Before changing
the configurations we recommend doing a backup of the files you change.
</p>

<h3>Change Ports</h3>
<p>
To change the ports open the server_80.xml which you find in tomcat/conf and change the 
non-SSL port. If you want to use it on port 8079 for example:
</p>

<pre>
	&lt;!-- Define a non-SSL HTTP/1.1 Connector on port 8079 --&gt; 
	&lt;Connector address=&quot;127.0.0.1&quot; port=&quot;8079&quot;...
</pre>
<p>
You can also change the SSL connector to another port of course.
In this example to port 8442:
</p>
<pre>
	&lt;!-- Define a SSL HTTP/1.1 Connector on port 8442 --&gt; 
	&lt;Connector address=&quot;127.0.0.1&quot; port=&quot;8442&quot;... 
</pre>
<br>

<h3>Make WebGoat Reachable From Another Client</h3>
<p>THIS MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO REALLY ATTACK YOUR SERVER! DO NOT DO THIS
	UNTIL YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING. THIS CONFIGURATION SHOULD BE ONLY USED IN 
SAFE NETWORKS!</p>
<p>By its default configurations WebGoat is only
reachable within the localhost. In a laboratory or a class
there is maybe the need of having a server and a few clients. 
In this case it is possible to make WebGoat reachable.
</p>
<p>The reason why WebGoat is only reachable within the localhost is
the parameter address in the connectors for the non-SSL and SSL connection in server_80.xml. It is set
to 127.0.0.1. The applications only listens on the port of this address for
incoming connections if it is set. If you remove this parameter the server listens on all IPs on the
specific port.</p>

<h3>Permit Only Certain Clients Connection</h3>
<p>
If you have made WebGoat reachable it is reachable for
all clients. If you want to make it reachable only for certain clients specified
by there IP you can archive this by using a 'Remote Address Filter'.
The filter can be set in a whitebox or blackbox approach. Here is
only discussed the whitebox approach. You have to add following lines to the Host section of web_80.xml:
</p>
<pre>
	&lt;Valve className=&quot;org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteAddrValve&quot;
	allow=&quot;127.0.0.1,ip1,ip2&quot;/&gt;
</pre>
<p>In this case only localhost, ip1 and ip2 are permitted to connect.</p>

<h2>WebGoat Default Users and Roles for Tomcat</h2>
<p>
WebGoat requires the following users and roles to be configured in order for the application to run.
<br/>
  <pre>
  &gt;role rolename="webgoat_basic"/&lt;
  &gt;role rolename="webgoat_admin"/&lt;
  &gt;role rolename="webgoat_user"/&lt;
  &gt;user username="webgoat" password="webgoat" roles="webgoat_admin"/&lt;
  &gt;user username="basic" password="basic" roles="webgoat_user,webgoat_basic"/&lt;
  &gt;user username="guest" password="guest" roles="webgoat_user"/&lt;
  </pre>
</p>
<h2>Adding Users</h2>
<p>
Usually using WebGoat you just use the user guest with the password guest.
But maybe in laboratory you have made a setup with one server and a lot of
clients. In this case you might want to have a user for every client
 and you have to alter tomcat-users.xml 
in tomcat/conf as the users are stored there. <b>We recommend not to use real passwords 
as the passwords are stored in plain text in this file!</b>
</p>
<h3>Add User</h3>
<p>
Adding a user is straight forward. You can use the guest entry as an example. The added
users should have the same role as the guest user. Add lines like this to the file:
</p>
<pre>
	&lt;user name=&quot;student1&quot; password=&quot;password1&quot; roles=&quot;webgoat_user&quot;/&gt;
	&lt;user name=&quot;student2&quot; password=&quot;password2&quot; roles=&quot;webgoat_user&quot;/&gt;
	...
</pre>
