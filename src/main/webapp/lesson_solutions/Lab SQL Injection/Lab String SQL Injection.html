<p><b>Lesson Plan Title:</b> How to Perform a SQLInjection</p>

<p><b>Concept / Topic To Teach:</b><br />
SQL injection attacks represent a serious threat to any database-driven
site. The methods behind an attack are easy to learn and the damage
caused can range from considerable to complete system compromise.
Despite these risks, an incredible number of systems on the internet are
susceptible to this form of attack.</p>

<p>Not only is it a threat easily instigated, it is also a threat
that, with a little common-sense and forethought, can easily be
prevented.</p>

<p>It is always good practice to sanitize all input data, especially
data that will used in OS command, scripts, and database queiries, even
if the threat of SQL injection has been prevented in some other manner.
</p>

<p><b>General Goal(s):</b><br />
For this exercise, you will perform SQLInjection attacks. You will also
implement code changes in the web application to defeat these attacks.</p>

<p><b>Solution:</b><br />
Select Neville as user to log in. Make sure WebScarab will intercept the next request.
Hit the Login Button and Change the password parameter in WebScarab to smith' OR '1' = '1. 
Et voila you are logged in as Neville without knowing the password as the query
will lookup if the password is smith and if not it controls if 1=1 what
return true.</p>
