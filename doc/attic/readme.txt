HOW WEBGOAT WORKS

TROUBLESHOOTING/FAQs:
Q. I put the OWASP downloaded war file in my tomcat/webapps directory and the 
   http://localhost/WebGoat/attack url doesn't work.
A. Rename the downloaded war file to WebGoat.war.  Delete the existing tomcat/webapps/*WebGoat* directories. Restart Tomcat.


Q. I dropped the WebGoat war file into my non-Tomcat application server and WebGoat doesn't seem to work.
A. WebGoat uses some of the internal Tomcat classes for user management.  Unfortunately, this makes 
   WebGoat dependent on Tomcat.  Hopefully, this will be addressed in a future release.


Q. Having problems with the ant file working properly. How do I configure my ant environment 
   so that I don't receive errors such as:
	- "Specified VM install not found: type Standard VM, name j2sdk1.4.2.06"
A. This usually indicates an Eclipse environment setting misconfiguration. Here are some possible solutions:
	i. Ant Runtime Configuration
		- Window > Preferences
		- Ant > Runtime
		- Under Classpath Tab check the "Global Entries"
		- Remove any jre "tools.jar" references
		- Add the "\tomcat\servers\lib\catalina-ant.jar" file.
		- Click Apply, Click OK.
		- Return to the Ant View and refresh.


Q. When I start up WebGoat it dies very quickly.
A. WebGoat is a Java application that runs on Tomcat using port 80.  If you have another 
   application listening on port 80 (like IIS), you will need to change WebGoat's port 
   (to 8080 or something) in the tomcat_root/conf/server.xml file.


Q. When I deploy the war file to the Tomcat wepapps directory, I can't login to WebGoat
A. You need to add the webgoat users and roles to tomcat/conf/tomcat-users.xml

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <tomcat-users>
      <role rolename="webgoat_basic"/>
      <role rolename="webgoat_admin"/>
      <role rolename="webgoat_user"/>
      <role rolename="tomcat"/>
      <user password="webgoat" roles="webgoat_admin" username="webgoat"/>
      <user password="basic" roles="webgoat_user,webgoat_basic" username="basic"/>
      <user password="tomcat" roles="tomcat" username="tomcat"/>
      <user password="guest" roles="webgoat_user" username="guest"/>
    </tomcat-users>


Q. How do I get configure WebGoat to run on an IP other then localhost?
A. In the webgoat.bat file, in the root directory, the following lines
   are executed: 

      delete .\tomcat\conf\server.xml 
      copy .\tomcat\conf\server_80.xml .\tomcat\conf\server.xml 

   This will overwrite any changes you may have made to server.xml 
   file that addressed this issue.... 

   By changing the server_80.xml file (or by removing the above code
   from webgoat.bat, after making your changes) you can reflect your
   changes to the Tomcat configuration. You will need to change the IP
   address in the server_80.xml file to be the IP of the host machine.

   The following connectors should be modified
      <!-- Define a non-SSL HTTP/1.1 Connector on port 8080 --> 
      <Connector address="10.20.20.123" port="80" 
      ... 
      <!-- Define a SSL HTTP/1.1 Connector on port 8443 --> 
      <Connector address="10.20.20.123" port="443" 
      .... 

   where the 127.0.0.1 will be replaced by your IP. In this case
   10.20.20.123
