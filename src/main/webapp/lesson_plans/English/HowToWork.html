<h1>How To Work With WebGoat</h1>
<p>
Welcome to a short introduction to WebGoat.<br> 
Here you will learn how to use WebGoat and additional tools for the lessons.<br><br>
</p>
<h2>Environment Information</h2>
<p>
WebGoat uses the Apache Tomcat server. It is configured to run on localhost although this can be
easily changed. This
configuration is for single user, additional users can be added in the tomcat-users.xml file. 
If you want to use WebGoat in a laboratory or in 
class you might need to change this setup. Please refer to the Tomcat Configuration 
in the Introduction section.</p>

<h2>Solve The Lesson</h2>
<p>
Always start with the lessons plan. Then try to solve the lesson and if necessary, 
use the hints. The last hint is the solution text if applicable.  If you cannot solve the lesson using the hints, you may view the 
solution for complete details.</p>
<h2>Read And Edit Parameters</h2>
<p>
To read and edit Parameters you need a local proxy to intercept the HTTP request. 
Here we use WebScarab. More information on WebScarab can be found in the "Useful Tools" Chapter.
</p>
<h2>Read And Edit Cookies</h2>
<p>
Often it is not only necessary to change the value of the parameters but to change the value of cookies.
WebScarab has functionality for this as well.
